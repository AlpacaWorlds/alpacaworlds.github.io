				<h2>Alpaca Worlds: The Origin</h2>
				<p>It all started a long time ago in the Andes. Way before the Spanish arrived in America. People enjoyed a
					peaceful life in the upper world, cherishing nature and sharing the mountains with a few short-haired alpacas
					owned by Apu, the god of mountains.</p>
				<p>Although, the alpacas we know and love today come from a different place: the underworld.
					The underworld is a magical place where the offspring of Andean people’s gods live. Overthere, Apu’s daughter
					took care of a large herd of beautiful long-haired alpacas.
				</p>
				<p>She was having a difficult time taking care of such a big herd on her own. Apu thought it was a good idea to
					have someone help his daughter and allowed her to marry a herdsman she fell in love with during one of her
					visits to the upper world.</p>
				<p>The herdsman moved to the underworld, and they were extremely happy for a while. But after some time, the
					herdsman started to feel homesick.</p>
				<p>The herdsman and Apu’s daughter asked Apu’s permission to move to the upper world and take the alpaca herd
					with them.
					Apu agreed under one condition: The herdsman shall continue taking care of the alpaca herd while taking
					special care of a tiny alpaca that he had to carry with him at all times.
					But back in the upper world, the herdsman didn’t keep his word. He stopped caring for the alpacas and
					disregarded the tiny special one.
				</p>
				<p>Extremely disappointed, Apu’s daughter decided to go back to the underworld with all the alpacas. So, she ran
					to the nearest water spring, where she dove and swam to the underworld. Most of her alpacas followed her
					except for a few the herdsman prevented from joining her.
					Since then, the alpacas live nearby lakes and springs, waiting for their mistress to come back.
				</p>
				<p>A few weeks ago, an alpaca heard a rumor: Apu’s daughter is back in the upper world. So, she decided to leave
					the mountains and started looking for her.</p>
				<p>Join us, and follow our alpaca in his quest for Apu’s daughter. We will visit the most exotic places all over
					the world while we help her find his mistress. And who knows, we might even have to follow him out of this
					world!</p>
